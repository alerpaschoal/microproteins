# UTFPR Bioinfo Course - Topic II: Microproteins 2025

This repository collects the course materials for two bioinformatics courses being taught by Prof. Alexandre R Paschoal at UTFPR in Spring 2025, for the [PPGAB](https://www.utfpr.edu.br/cursos/programas-de-pos-graduacao/ppgab-cp) and [PPGBIOINFO](https://www.utfpr.edu.br/cursos/programas-de-pos-graduacao/ppgbioinfo-cp) degrees: 

* Emerging Topics in Bioinformatics II:
  * PGAB012 - PhD Level
  * PGBIOINFO201 - Master Level 

The topic for this year is: Microproteins.
Lectures are on Mondays at 6:50PM UK London time.
It is the same course, but two levels, one for a master's and another for a PhD. The lectures are open for online auditing; please reach out to paschoal@utfpr.edu.br if you'd like to audit. The materials will be made available in this repository.

### Evaluation (for enrolled students)
The evaluation for this course will be comprised of:

* (10%) Attendance/quizzes
* (15%) Problem sets (PS), may be solved in groups but turned in individually
* (20%) One midterm project to be done in groups of 2-4 people, to be presented on May
* (55%) One final project will be done in groups of 2-4 people. To be presented at the end of June and the beginning of July.
